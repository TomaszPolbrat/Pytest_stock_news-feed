# Pytest_stock_news-feed

Concept of this project is simple. First I've created small program to analyze value of a stock market (Tesla Inc. in this file). Then, I've made a tests that will verify
if data is being processed in the right way using Pytest.

to use it, you need to simply instal Pytest with "pip install -U pytest" command in your cmd. Then go to the file directory and write "pytest -v". The result should be
4 /4 tests passed (all green).

Part of the project was inspired by Angela Yu's "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023", Udemy
course.
